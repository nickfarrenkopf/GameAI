This project contains 3 major projects: GridWorld, EmulatorAI, & HearthstoneAI

Gridworld
 - My first project exploring Reinforcement Learning
 - Follows concepts found in "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton & Barto
 - Has 6+ grid environments, where an object in 1 square would learn to reach a goal by randomly taking actions
 - Grids had some tweakable parameters that showed the changes in different learning algorithms

EmulatorAI
 - Game AI playing GameBoy Advance games on an emulator console
 - AI was able to play 3+ basic games (although not very well), as well as read inputs from 3+ others
 - Most trained game: PacMan

HearthstoneAI
 - GameAI playing the online trading card game Hearthstone
 - Program was able to read the field & output parameters (like total health left, cards in hand, cards on field)
 - Built framework for it to be able to make decisions, but never had enough data or tech to actually train the models
